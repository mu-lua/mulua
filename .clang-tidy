  "IMPORTANT
  clang-tidy doesn't support comments but we can simulate comments by just
  writing text directly here. These are then interpreted as warnings and will
  be dropped. As long as you start every sentence with a capital letter and
  don't use commas in your `comments` you should be fine

  Enable all warnings by default.
